<b>Question:</b>
```
Register an application with the Github API here https://github.com/settings/applications. 
Access the API to get information on your instructors repositories 
(hint: this is the url you want "https://api.github.com/users/jtleek/repos"). 
Use this data to find the time that the datasharing repo was created. What time was it created? 
This tutorial may be useful (https://github.com/hadley/httr/blob/master/demo/oauth2-github.r). 
You may also need to run the code in the base R package and not R studio.

(ii) 2014-03-05T16:11:46Z
(iii) 2013-11-07T13:25:07Z
(iv) 2014-02-06T16:13:11Z
```
<b>Solution:</b>
```R
> library(httr)
> oauth_endpoints("github")
<oauth_endpoint>
 authorize: https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize
 access:    https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token
> myapp <- oauth_app("github", "ClientID", "ClientSecret")
> github_token <- oauth2.0_token(oauth_endpoints("github"), myapp)
> req <- GET("https://api.github.com/rate_limit", config(token = github_token))
> stop_for_status(req)
> content(req)
> BROWSE("https://api.github.com/users/jtleek/repos",authenticate("Access Token","x-oauth-basic","basic"))
```
