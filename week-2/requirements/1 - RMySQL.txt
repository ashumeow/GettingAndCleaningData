For RMySQL:-
Step 1:
Go to MySQL official link --> https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/
As a windows user who don't have MS office and MS Visual studio, i didn't download full version or development version.
I simply directly downloaded "MySQL Server". That is more enough and it doesn't require any prior requirements.
We need database server host to launch RSQL stuffs & that's why we are downloading MySQL... So, MySQL server itself is enough. ;)
If you're downloading full version or developer one, then you need to have some MS Office packages as well as Visual Studio.

Step 2:
Goto RStudio,
install.packages("RMySQL")

That's it. =)
