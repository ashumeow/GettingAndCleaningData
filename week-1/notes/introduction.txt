PART - 1 - Raw and Processed Data

Data can be expressed as a qualitative or quantitative variables belonging to a set of entities.

What is Getting the Data all about?
It's all about processing a raw data into a tidy data.

Raw data is the orginal source.
Functions:- Undergoes processing which can only be done once.

Processed data is the data that's ready for analysis.
Functions:- Merging, Subsetting, Transforming.
Mandatory:- All steps will be recorded.

Example of processing pipeline:-

PART - 2 - Components of Tidy Data

Requiremens while converting from Raw Data into Tidy Data:-
(i) Raw data
(ii) Tidy dataset
(iii) Codebook for describing each vars. and vals. in tidy dataset
(iv) Explicit & each recipe from step 1 -> steps 2,3

How to judge if it's raw data?
(i) Unformatted Excel file
(ii) Complicated JSON data while scraping from Twitter API
(iii) Strange binary file 
(iv) Hand-written numbers collected while looking through a microscope

When the raw data is seen in good form?
(i) No software executed on the data
(ii) No data manipulation
(iii) No data removal from the dataset
(iv) No data summarization

Requirements for Tidy data:-
(i) Each measured var. should be in 1 column
(ii) Each diff. observation of that var. should be in a different row
(iii) There should be 1 table for each kind/type of var.
(iv) If it's multiple tables, then a table column should be included that allows to get linked.
(v) Some important tips:
(v.a) 1 row should be included at top of each file with var. names.
(v.b) Must make var. names as human readable.
(v.c) General table should be saved in 1 file per table.

Code book:-
(i) Information about the vars. in the dataset stored that's not found in the tidy data
(ii) Information about summary choices
(iii) Information about the experimental study design
(iv) Important tips:
(iv.a) Word/text file is the common format
(iv.b) A separate section called as "study design" that describes how the data has been collected.
(iv.c) A separate section called as "code book" which describes each var. and it's units

Instruction List:-
(i) Overview
The input for the script -> raw data
The output -> processed and tidy data
No parameters
(ii) Steps
Step 1: Take raw file and summarize S/W with parameters (like a, b and c assigning some values)
Step 2: Run S/W separately for each sample
Step 3: Take column as .out for each sample which is the corresponding row in the output dataset
