Version 0.4-0 included new data defaults. See ?getSymbols.
> amzn <- getSymbols("AMZN", auto.assign = FALSE)
    As of 0.4-0, ‘getSymbols’ uses env=parent.frame() and
 auto.assign=TRUE by default.

 This  behavior  will be  phased out in 0.5-0  when the call  will
 default to use auto.assign=FALSE. getOption("getSymbols.env") and 
 getOptions("getSymbols.auto.assign") are now checked for alternate defaults

 This message is shown once per session and may be disabled by setting 
 options("getSymbols.warning4.0"=FALSE). See ?getSymbols for more details.
